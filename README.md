# Abstract

This is my blog based on jekyll with Github. In this blog,

1. Solutions for issues I've encounted during study and work
2. Study notes, thoughts, and some screenshot
3. Some books, quotes, my stories, etc I like to track 

**I am using theJekyll theme by [Gaohaoyang](https://github.com/Gaohaoyang/gaohaoyang.github.io), a very nice theme **

# Update News:

2015-06-24: Moving my old posts to github, many are study notes. A lot of work! I would like to do it slowly. And I am planning to upload some of my projects.
