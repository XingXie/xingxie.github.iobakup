### Modules ###
In nginx.conf,

Core Modules: must in the root level, like pid, user, etc.

In order for us to set up a load balancer, we will need 2 modules: the proxy module and the upstream module. Both are built into Nginx by default.
That being said, if we want to ensure that all requests from the same visitor always get processed by the same backend server, we need to enable the ip_hash option when declaring the upstream block.
