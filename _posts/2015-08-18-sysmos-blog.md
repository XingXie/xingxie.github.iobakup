### [QUALITATIVE VS QUANTITATIVE SOCIAL MEDIA REPORTING](http://blog.sysomos.com/2015/07/28/qualitative-vs-quantitative-social-media-reporting/)

**Quantitative** reporting means presenting hard numbers as your measurements. Think of “quantity.” Quantitative measurements are things that are real measurements, These are going to be all of the things that you can actually count and show cold hard facts towards. 

**Qualitative** reporting has less to do with hard numbers and more to do with the underlying meaning and interpretations behind those numbers. These are going to be the things that add meaning and value to your hard numbers. Example: sentiment analysis

My best suggestion would be to do what I do when I create reports and use a mix of both. Show the numbers that matter towards your goals with qualitative measurements, but then dig deeper with a qualitative analysis as to why those numbers were showing as they did. What drove them? What was the underlying meaning of all those numbers? What’s the story behind the numbers?
