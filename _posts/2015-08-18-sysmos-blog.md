### [WORK HACK WEDNESDAY: MANAGING THE INFORMATION OVERLOAD AND GETTING TO THE GOOD STUFF #WHW](http://blog.sysomos.com/2015/08/12/work-hack-wednesday-managing-the-information-overload-and-getting-to-the-good-stuff-whw/)

("Google" OR "@Google" OR "#Google") AND ("Alphabet" OR "#Alphabet")

\# hastag means the user-defined categories. The search result by **MAP** can be selectively saved in an app **Pocket**. 
Pocket is an app for managing content you find on the Internet that you wish to enjoy at a later time (blogs, articles, videos etc.).
Once saved to Pocket, the list of content is visible on any device – phone, tablet or computer.

### [QUALITATIVE VS QUANTITATIVE SOCIAL MEDIA REPORTING](http://blog.sysomos.com/2015/07/28/qualitative-vs-quantitative-social-media-reporting/)

**Quantitative** reporting means presenting hard numbers as your measurements. Think of “quantity.” Quantitative measurements are things that are real measurements, These are going to be all of the things that you can actually count and show cold hard facts towards. 

**Qualitative** reporting has less to do with hard numbers and more to do with the underlying meaning and interpretations behind those numbers. These are going to be the things that add meaning and value to your hard numbers. Example: sentiment analysis

My best suggestion would be to do what I do when I create reports and use a mix of both. Show the numbers that matter towards your goals with qualitative measurements, but then dig deeper with a qualitative analysis as to why those numbers were showing as they did. What drove them? What was the underlying meaning of all those numbers? What’s the story behind the numbers?

### [SOCIAL MEDIA REPORTING: WHERE TO START](http://blog.sysomos.com/2015/07/07/how-to-start-your-social-reporting/)

Goals for social media should be **S.M.A.R.T.** This is a simple acronym that means your goals should be Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound. So, for example, you want to get into social media so you can increase the public awareness of your brand, you should have a corresponding goal that would be something like “gain 1000 new fans/followers over our first 3 months.”

### [WHY REPORTING IS CRUCIAL TO YOUR COMPANY’S SOCIAL EFFORTS](http://blog.sysomos.com/2015/07/02/why-reporting-is-crucial-to-companys-social-efforts/)

However, I feel a project isn’t truly complete until reporting and lessons learned have been discussed. Reporting should **never** be an afterthought, it should be part of a project’s flow and timeline.

### [USE SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE TO DESIGN CONTENT YOUR AUDIENCE WANTS](http://blog.sysomos.com/2015/06/02/use-social-intelligence-to-design-content-your-audience-wants/)

1. First, you want to start searching for your brand name or topics around your industry to discover where people are talking.

2. Second, when you’ve determined where the conversation is already happening it’s time to learn about HOW they’re happening.
3. Now how can you figure what else they like so that you can tie it back to your brand? Again, the answer is with some research, and text analytics are always a great tool when trying to figure out what people are interested in.

4. Just noticing what people are talking about around your industry can give you great ideas for what themes you should be focusing your content on.

1. Find where people are talking
2. Determine the real hotspots of activity for your community. a. sing Sysomos’s Most Authoritative tool can help you determine the blogs or people with the highest authority score that are talking about your brand or your search terms. b. There are plenty of people out there that may be super fans of your brand or highly interested in your space and talking about it that aren’t necessarily your typical “influencer”.
3. Learn what your community values and give them lots of it. (Text cloud and Buzzgraph)
