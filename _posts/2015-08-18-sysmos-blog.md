### [WORK HACK WEDNESDAY: MANAGING THE INFORMATION OVERLOAD AND GETTING TO THE GOOD STUFF #WHW](http://blog.sysomos.com/2015/08/12/work-hack-wednesday-managing-the-information-overload-and-getting-to-the-good-stuff-whw/)

\# hastag means the user-defined categories. The search result by **MAP** can be selectively saved in an app **Pocket**. 
Pocket is an app for managing content you find on the Internet that you wish to enjoy at a later time (blogs, articles, videos etc.).
Once saved to Pocket, the list of content is visible on any device – phone, tablet or computer.

### [QUALITATIVE VS QUANTITATIVE SOCIAL MEDIA REPORTING](http://blog.sysomos.com/2015/07/28/qualitative-vs-quantitative-social-media-reporting/)

**Quantitative** reporting means presenting hard numbers as your measurements. Think of “quantity.” Quantitative measurements are things that are real measurements, These are going to be all of the things that you can actually count and show cold hard facts towards. 

**Qualitative** reporting has less to do with hard numbers and more to do with the underlying meaning and interpretations behind those numbers. These are going to be the things that add meaning and value to your hard numbers. Example: sentiment analysis

My best suggestion would be to do what I do when I create reports and use a mix of both. Show the numbers that matter towards your goals with qualitative measurements, but then dig deeper with a qualitative analysis as to why those numbers were showing as they did. What drove them? What was the underlying meaning of all those numbers? What’s the story behind the numbers?

### [SOCIAL MEDIA REPORTING: WHERE TO START](http://blog.sysomos.com/2015/07/07/how-to-start-your-social-reporting/)

Goals for social media should be **S.M.A.R.T.** This is a simple acronym that means your goals should be Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound. So, for example, you want to get into social media so you can increase the public awareness of your brand, you should have a corresponding goal that would be something like “gain 1000 new fans/followers over our first 3 months.”

### [WHY REPORTING IS CRUCIAL TO YOUR COMPANY’S SOCIAL EFFORTS](http://blog.sysomos.com/2015/07/02/why-reporting-is-crucial-to-companys-social-efforts/)

However, I feel a project isn’t truly complete until reporting and lessons learned have been discussed. Reporting should **never** be an afterthought, it should be part of a project’s flow and timeline.
