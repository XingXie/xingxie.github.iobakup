### So Good They Can't Ignore You - by Cal Newport ###

Motivation requires that you fulfill three basic psychological needs:
* Autonomy: the feeling that you have control over your day, and that your actions are important
* Competence: the feeling that you are good at what you do
* Relatedness: the feeling of connection to other people

Put aside the question of whether your job is your true passion, 
and instead turn your focus toward becoming so good they can't ignore you.	

The traits that define great work are rare and valuable.

Supply and demand says you need rare and valuable skills to offer in return.

These rare and valuable skills are your career capital.

The craftsman mindset leads to acquiring career capital. 	

Three Disqualifiers for Applying the Craftsman Mindset

1. The job presents few opportunities to distinguish yourself by developing relevant skills that are rare and valuable.
2. The job focuses on something you think is useless or perhaps even actively bad for the world.
3. The job forces you to work with people you really dislike.

Do projects where you'll be forced to show your work to others.

To maximize your chances of success, you should deploy small, concrete experiments that return concrete feedback. Explore the specific avenues surrounding your general mission, looking for those with the highest likelihood of leading to outstanding results.

### The Personal MBA - by Josh Kaufman ###

1. Value Creation
Discovering what people need or want, then creating it

2. Marketing
Attracting attention and building demand for what you’ve created

3. Sales
Turning prospective customers into paying customers

4. Value Delivery
Giving your customers what you’ve promised and ensuring that they’re satisfied

5. Finance
Bringing in enough money to keep going and make your effort worthwhile

All successful businesses sell some combination of money, status, power, love, knowledge, protection, pleasure, and excitement. The more clearly you articulate how your product satisfies one or more of these drives, the more attractive your offer will become.

RATE EACH OF THE TEN FACTORS BELOW ON A SCALE OF 0 TO 10

1. Urgency - How badly do people want or need this right now?

2. Market Size - How many people are actively purchasing things like this?

3. Pricing Potential - What is the highest price a typical purchaser would be willing to spend

4. Cost of Customer Acquisition - How easy is it to acquire a new customer?

5. Cost of Value Delivery - How much would it cost to create and deliver the value offered, both in money and effort?

6. Uniqueness of Offer - How unique is your offer versus competing offerings in the market, and how easy is it for potential competitors to copy you?

7. Speed to Market - How quickly can you create something to sell?

8. Up-Front Investment - How much will you have to invest before you’re ready to sell?

9. Upsell Potential - Are there related secondary offers that you could also present to purchasing customers?

10. Evergreen Potential - Once the initial offer has been created, how much additional work will you have to put into it in order to continue selling?

If there are several successful businesses serving a market, you don’t have to worry so much about investing in a dead end, since you already know that people are buying.

TWELVE STANDARD FORMS OF VALUE

1. Product
Create a single tangible item or entity, then sell and deliver it for more than what it cost to make.

If you’re not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late.

Pick three key attributes or features, get those things very, very right, and then forget about everything else. By focusing on only a few core features in the first version, you are forced to find the true essence and value of the product.

2. Service
Provide help or assistance, then charge a fee for the benefits rendered.

3. Shared Resource
Create a durable asset that can be used by many people, then charge for access.

The tricky part about offering a Shared Resource is carefully monitoring usage levels.

Finding the sweet spot between too few members and too many is the key to making a Shared Resource work.

4. Subscription
Offer a benefit on an ongoing basis, and charge a recurring fee.

The key to Subscription offers is doing everything you can to keep customer attrition as low as possible.

5. Resale
Acquire an asset from a wholesaler, then sell that asset to a retail buyer at a higher price.

6. Lease
Acquire an asset, then allow another person to use that asset for a predefined amount of time in exchange for a fee.

7. Agency
Market and sell an asset or service you don’t own on behalf of a third party, then collect a percentage of the transaction price as a fee.

8. Audience Aggregation
Get the attention of a group of people with certain characteristics, then sell access in the form of advertising to another business looking to reach that audience.

9. Loan
Lend a certain amount of money, then collect payments over a predefined period of time equal to the original loan plus a predefined interest rate.

10. Option
Offer the ability to take a predefined action for a fixed period of time in exchange for a fee.

11. Insurance
Take on the risk of some specific bad thing happening to the policy holder in exchange for a predefined series of payments, then pay out claims only when the bad thing actually happens.

12. Capital
Purchase an ownership stake in a business, then collect a corresponding portion of the profit as a one-time payout or ongoing dividend.

When creating a new offering, your primary goal should be to work your way through each Iteration Cycle as quickly as possible. Iteration is a structured form of learning that helps you make your offering better; the faster you learn, the more quickly you’ll be able to improve.

“No business plan survives first contact with customers.” - Steve Blank

Getting useful Feedback from your potential customers is the core of the Iteration Cycle.

Ask open-ended questions.

Two primary characteristics: convenience and fidelity.
Things that are quick, reliable, easy, and flexible are convenient.
Things that offer quality, status, aesthetic appeal, or emotional impact are high-fidelity.
Almost every improvement you make to an offer can be thought of in terms of improving either convenience or fidelity.
It’s incredibly difficult to optimize for both fidelity and convenience at the same time, so the most successful offerings try to provide the most convenience or fidelity among all competing offerings.

Your job as a marketer isn’t to convince people to want what you’re offering: it’s to help your prospects convince themselves that what you’re offering will help them get what they really want.

The best businesses in the world earn the trust of their prospects and help them understand why the offer is worth paying for. No one wants to make a bad decision or be taken advantage of, so sales mostly consists of helping the prospect understand what’s important and convincing them you’re capable of actually delivering on what you promise.

In the classic sales book SPIN Selling, Neil Rackham describes the four phases of successful selling:
(1) understanding the situation
(2) defining the problem
(3) clarifying the short-term and long-term implications of that problem
(4) quantifying the need-payoff, or the financial and emotional benefits the customer would experience after the resolution of their problem.

The performance of the offering must surpass the customer’s expectations in order for them to be satisfied.

“Don’t compete with rivals - make them irrelevant.” - W. Chan Kim, Blue Ocean Strategy

There are only four ways to increase your business’s revenue: 
1. Increase the number of customers you serve. 
2. Increase the average size of each Transaction by selling more. 
3. Increase the frequency of transactions per customer. 
4. Raise your prices.
 
Great management is boring - and often unrewarding. The hallmark of an effective manager is anticipating likely issues and resolving them in advance, before they become an issue. Some of the best managers in the world look like they’re not doing much, but everything gets done on time and under budget.

“To think is easy. To act is difficult. To act as one thinks is the most difficult.” - Goethe

“What are the two or three most important things that I need to do today? What are the things that - if I got them done today - would make a huge difference?” Write only those tasks on your MIT list, then try to get them done first thing in the morning.

**Setting an artificial deadline is extremely effective. If you set a goal to have all of your MITs done by 10:00 a.m., you’ll be amazed at how quickly you can complete the day’s most important tasks.**

**By taking a few moments to consciously decide what you’re interested in and what you’re looking for, you can program your mind to alert you when it notices something relevant.**

Testing is the best way to ensure that your life gets better over time. By constantly trying new things, you’re learning what works for you and what doesn’t. Over time, you’ll discover Patterns - things that make your life better and things that make your life worse.

**If you don’t have a plan, your actions will be determined by someone else. By refusing to make the effort to move in the direction you think is best, you’re ceding Power to those who do have plans.**

**We find comfort among those who agree with us, and growth among those who don’t.**

### A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy - by William Irvine ###

You are unlikely to have a good and meaningful life unless your can overcome your insatiability.

**Philosophers provided their pupils with a philosophy of life: They taught them what things in life were worth pursuing and how best to pursue them.**

**If you periodically experience minor discomforts, you will grow confident that you can withstand major discomforts as well. So you won't fear experiencing such discomforts at some future time. By experiencing minor discomforts, you train yourself to be courageous.**
