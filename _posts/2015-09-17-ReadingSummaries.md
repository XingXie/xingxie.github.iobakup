### So Good They Can't Ignore You - by Cal Newport ###

Motivation requires that you fulfill three basic psychological needs:
* Autonomy: the feeling that you have control over your day, and that your actions are important
* Competence: the feeling that you are good at what you do
* Relatedness: the feeling of connection to other people

Put aside the question of whether your job is your true passion, 
and instead turn your focus toward becoming so good they can't ignore you.	

The traits that define great work are rare and valuable.

Supply and demand says you need rare and valuable skills to offer in return.

These rare and valuable skills are your career capital.

The craftsman mindset leads to acquiring career capital. 	

Three Disqualifiers for Applying the Craftsman Mindset

1. The job presents few opportunities to distinguish yourself by developing relevant skills that are rare and valuable.
2. The job focuses on something you think is useless or perhaps even actively bad for the world.
3. The job forces you to work with people you really dislike.

Do projects where you'll be forced to show your work to others.

To maximize your chances of success, you should deploy small, concrete experiments that return concrete feedback. Explore the specific avenues surrounding your general mission, looking for those with the highest likelihood of leading to outstanding results.
