### So Good They Can't Ignore You - by Cal Newport ###

Motivation requires that you fulfill three basic psychological needs:
* Autonomy: the feeling that you have control over your day, and that your actions are important
* Competence: the feeling that you are good at what you do
* Relatedness: the feeling of connection to other people

Put aside the question of whether your job is your true passion, 
and instead turn your focus toward becoming so good they can't ignore you.	

The traits that define great work are rare and valuable.

Supply and demand says you need rare and valuable skills to offer in return.

These rare and valuable skills are your career capital.

The craftsman mindset leads to acquiring career capital. 	

Three Disqualifiers for Applying the Craftsman Mindset

1. The job presents few opportunities to distinguish yourself by developing relevant skills that are rare and valuable.
2. The job focuses on something you think is useless or perhaps even actively bad for the world.
3. The job forces you to work with people you really dislike.

Do projects where you'll be forced to show your work to others.

To maximize your chances of success, you should deploy small, concrete experiments that return concrete feedback. Explore the specific avenues surrounding your general mission, looking for those with the highest likelihood of leading to outstanding results.

### The Personal MBA - by Josh Kaufman ###

1. Value Creation
Discovering what people need or want, then creating it

2. Marketing
Attracting attention and building demand for what you’ve created

3. Sales
Turning prospective customers into paying customers

4. Value Delivery
Giving your customers what you’ve promised and ensuring that they’re satisfied

5. Finance
Bringing in enough money to keep going and make your effort worthwhile

All successful businesses sell some combination of money, status, power, love, knowledge, protection, pleasure, and excitement. The more clearly you articulate how your product satisfies one or more of these drives, the more attractive your offer will become.

RATE EACH OF THE TEN FACTORS BELOW ON A SCALE OF 0 TO 10

1. Urgency - How badly do people want or need this right now?

2. Market Size - How many people are actively purchasing things like this?

3. Pricing Potential - What is the highest price a typical purchaser would be willing to spend

4. Cost of Customer Acquisition - How easy is it to acquire a new customer?

5. Cost of Value Delivery - How much would it cost to create and deliver the value offered, both in money and effort?

6. Uniqueness of Offer - How unique is your offer versus competing offerings in the market, and how easy is it for potential competitors to copy you?

7. Speed to Market - How quickly can you create something to sell?

8. Up-Front Investment - How much will you have to invest before you’re ready to sell?

9. Upsell Potential - Are there related secondary offers that you could also present to purchasing customers?

10. Evergreen Potential - Once the initial offer has been created, how much additional work will you have to put into it in order to continue selling?

If there are several successful businesses serving a market, you don’t have to worry so much about investing in a dead end, since you already know that people are buying.

TWELVE STANDARD FORMS OF VALUE

1. Product
Create a single tangible item or entity, then sell and deliver it for more than what it cost to make.

2. Service
Provide help or assistance, then charge a fee for the benefits rendered.

3. Shared Resource
Create a durable asset that can be used by many people, then charge for access.

4. Subscription
Offer a benefit on an ongoing basis, and charge a recurring fee.

5. Resale
Acquire an asset from a wholesaler, then sell that asset to a retail buyer at a higher price.

6. Lease
Acquire an asset, then allow another person to use that asset for a predefined amount of time in exchange for a fee.

7. Agency
Market and sell an asset or service you don’t own on behalf of a third party, then collect a percentage of the transaction price as a fee.

8. Audience Aggregation
Get the attention of a group of people with certain characteristics, then sell access in the form of advertising to another business looking to reach that audience.

9. Loan
Lend a certain amount of money, then collect payments over a predefined period of time equal to the original loan plus a predefined interest rate.

10. Option
Offer the ability to take a predefined action for a fixed period of time in exchange for a fee.

11. Insurance
Take on the risk of some specific bad thing happening to the policy holder in exchange for a predefined series of payments, then pay out claims only when the bad thing actually happens.

12. Capital
Purchase an ownership stake in a business, then collect a corresponding portion of the profit as a one-time payout or ongoing dividend.
