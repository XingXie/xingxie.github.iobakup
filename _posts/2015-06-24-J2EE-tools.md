## JMX Jconsole Mbean

By Jconsole, you can change the attributes in real time for computation. JMX is a monitor/management tool.

To manage resources using the JMX technology, you must first instrument the resources in the Java programming language. You use Java objects known as MBeans to implement the access to the resources' instrumentation. MBeans must follow the design patterns and interfaces defined in the JMX specification.
JMX Agent

A JMX technology-based agent (JMX agent) is a standard management agent that directly controls resources and makes them available to remote management applications. JMX agents are usually located on the same machine as the resources they control, but this arrangement is not a requirement.
The core component of a JMX agent is the MBean server, a managed object server in which MBeans are registered.
Remote Management

JMX technology instrumentation can be accessed in many different ways, either through existing management protocols such as the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) or through proprietary protocols.

[Jconsole example](http://alvinalexander.com/blog/post/java/source-code-java-jmx-hello-world-application)

### SIMPLE example

First of all we need to create MBean and for that we need to first create the interface that defines the attributes and operations that we want to expose. The interface name must end with MBean. If you just want to allow read-only, you can leave setter methods. cashMXBean has attributes and function definition in MBean.

~~~ java
    // any method starting with get and set are considered
    // as attributes getter and setter methods you can see it from JConsole!, so I am
    // using do* for operation.
    public String doConfig();

class cash implements cashMBean{}
~~~

Next step is to provide the actual implementation of the MBean interface. The JMX Naming convention is to keep the implementation class name as interface name â€“ MBean.  cash provides the function of instrucmental resources.

~~~ java
public class SystemConfigManagement {
    private static final int DEFAULT_NO_THREADS=10;
    private static final String DEFAULT_SCHEMA="default";
    public static void main(String[] args) throws MalformedObjectNameException, InterruptedException, InstanceAlreadyExistsException, MBeanRegistrationException, NotCompliantMBeanException {
        //Get the MBean server
        MBeanServer mbs = ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer();
        //register the MBean
        SystemConfig mBean = new SystemConfig(DEFAULT_NO_THREADS, DEFAULT_SCHEMA);
        ObjectName name = new ObjectName("com.journaldev.jmx:type=SystemConfig");
        mbs.registerMBean(mBean, name);
        do{
            Thread.sleep(3000);
            System.out.println("Thread Count="+mBean.getThreadCount()+":::Schema Name="+mBean.getSchemaName());
        }
// the only way to stop it is to change the count in jconsole
while(mBean.getThreadCount() !=0);
         
    }
}
~~~
